# Blogify
A simple, easy to use blogging platform written in PHP. MySQL is used for the back-end, and JavaScrit for the Front-end.

##Features
Blogify has the ability to support multiple users, each with their own profile and available content.
Each user can set up their own profile with their personal/professional information, submit blog posts that support HTML,
and implement custom settings to their blog.

##PHP
Blogify's foundation is in PHP, which takes part in verifying, creating, editing, and deleting data.

##MySQL
Blogify's Database is a MySQL database. Soon I'll add the ER Diagram for the structure of the database and the relations
between the data and tables.

##JavaScript
Blogify's Front-end content is handled by JavaScript, such as handling and passing forms, creating slick animations,
visualizing data, and generating a pleasant and easy-to-use UI.
